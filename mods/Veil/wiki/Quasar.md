### Particle Emitters

Particle emitters are the starting point for everything related to Quasar’s particles. They define a few variables about
themselves like lifetime and the rate at which they emit particles, but more importantly they hold the links to the
Particle data and Shape that each describe specific properties of the spawned particles.

### Modules

Modules are the most powerful building block of Quasar. A module is code attached to a particle, where it is executed at
a specific time, depending on which kind of module it is. They are what makes particles dynamic by defining movement,
color changes or light emission.

The simplest module definition would look like this:

```json
{
  "module": "die_on_collision"
}
```

Modules are interacted with by making a json for the Module instance, telling it which `module` to use and adding the
parameters the module takes in as further fields.

We are gonna go into more detail how they work internally in [
`Creating Costum Modules`](https://github.com/foundrymc/veil/wiki/quasar#creating-costum-modules).

### Particle Data

| Folder | modules/particle_data                                                                                                               |
|--------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Link   | [Github](https://github.com/FoundryMC/Veil/blob/1.20/common/src/main/java/foundry/veil/api/quasar/data/QuasarParticleData.java#L52) |

Defines the modules to attach to a particle and optionally the texture(s) for it. Also defines collision and the render
style, which can be either `CUBE` or `BILLBOARD`. `BILLBOARD` is meant for particles with Textures that always face the
player, whereas `CUBE` displays colored, textureless cubes.

### Shape

| Folder | modules/emitter/particle/shape                                                                                    |
|--------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Link   | [Github](https://github.com/FoundryMC/Veil/tree/1.20/common/src/main/java/foundry/veil/api/quasar/emitters/shape) |

A shape describes where relative to the location of the Particle Emitter to spawn the individual particles. When
spawning the particle a random point on the surface of the shape is picked

Possible Shapes (Lower- or Uppercase works):

- `point`
- `hemisphere`(half sphere)
- `cylinder`
- `sphere`
- `cube`
- `torus`(Donut)
- `disc`
- `plane`

### Particle Settings

| Folder | modules/emitter/particle                                                                                                          |
|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Link   | [Github](https://github.com/FoundryMC/Veil/blob/1.20/common/src/main/java/foundry/veil/api/quasar/data/ParticleSettings.java#L26) |

Sets lifetime, size, speed, initial rotation and the ranges for randomizing them.

# Working with Quasar

### Codecs:

Quasar uses so-called Codecs to read it‘s particles from Resource Packs. If you are not familiar with what a Codec is,
read it up [here](https://gist.github.com/Drullkus/1bca3f2d7f048b1fe03be97c28f87910) or, if you are more familiar with
Java, [here](https://docs.fabricmc.net/develop/codecs) and [here](https://docs.neoforged.net/docs/datastorage/codecs).

When you don‘t know what a entry should look like, search it up on [Veil‘s Github](https://github.com/FoundryMC/Veil)
or, if it is a Minecraft Codec,
using [linkie](https://linkie.shedaniel.dev/mappings?namespace=mojang_raw&version=1.20.1&search=&translateMode=none).

### Particle Editor

Not Currently Finished! Please return at a later point for documentation and use the `Resource Browser` or a Text Editor
of your choice for now.

### Resource Browser

Veil has a Resource browser that allows you to edit any text file from any resource pack in-game and save it. It can be
opened by pressing the (by default) F6 key and clicking on the `Resource` Tab. Files can be edited by clicking on them
with the Right mouse button, which will open a context window with the `Open in Veil Text Editor` option. This will open
a Code editor layered over Minecraft. When you have edited the file and want to apply the changes, save it using the
editor and either press `F3+t` or use the `Reload Resources` button at the top of the Resource Browser window to reload
all Resource Packs.

# Getting started

### Setting up the resource pack

Let‘s start by creating a resource pack with a folder structure for our particle in the `resourcepacks` folder of a
Minecraft Instance running Veil:

```markdown
resourcepacks
\-particles
  |-pack.mcmeta
    \-assets
      \-modid
        \-quasar
          |-emitters
          |-modules
            |-render
            |-update
            |-init
            |-force
            |---collision
            \-particle_data
              \-emitter
                \-particle
                  \-shape
```

Note that you have to replace `modid` with the ID of the mod you want to add Particles for.

For your pack.mcmeta you can just put something like this where Pack format 15 is for Minecraft
1.20.1. [For the other ones look here](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Pack_format#List_of_resource_pack_formats)

```json
{
  "pack": {
    "pack_format": 15,
    "description": "Resource pack for testing Quasar"
  }
}
```

### Making a particle

In this section I would go through all the files of a full particle definition and explain each file on an Example

### Spawning particles

#### Java

Since Quasar uses Resource packs for it‘s particles, it is suggested to make the code for spawning particles
fault-tolerant. A method like this could be located in your Mods Client class to access it quickly. Since this code is
wrapped in a `try`-`catch`-block it will just stop executing if it encounters a error at any point:

```java
public static void spawnParticle(Entity entity, ResourceLocation id){
    try {
        ParticleSystemManager manager = VeilRenderSystem.renderer().getParticleManager();
        ParticleEmitter emitter = manager.createEmitter(id);
        emitter.setAttachedEntity(entity);
        manager.addParticleSystem(emitter);
    } catch (Exception ignored) {

    }
}
public static void spawnParticle(Vec3 position, ResourceLocation id){
    try {
        ParticleSystemManager manager = VeilRenderSystem.renderer().getParticleManager();
        ParticleEmitter emitter = manager.createEmitter(id);
        emitter.setPosition(position);
        manager.addParticleSystem(emitter);
    } catch (Exception ignored) {

    }
}
```

#### Command

You can also use the `/quasar` command to spawn the particle. It’s syntax is `/quasar <particleemitter> <position>`.
Please note that this command only exists client-side and can therefore not be executed by anything other than the
player directly.

# Modules

All available Modules and their IDs for use in the Particle Module data can be
found [here.](https://github.com/FoundryMC/Veil/blob/4361244986c2c6d3430484c11b72f83dd3cd5e9b/common/src/main/java/foundry/veil/api/quasar/data/module/ModuleType.java#L19-L54)

Example modules for explaining structure: Dieoncollision&Trail?

In case we‘ve lost you somewhere between Particle Module Data, Module Data and Modules here‘s the terminology:

**Module Data**: Json-defined parameters for a specific Module. The corresponding Java record handles applying modules
to the particle based on the data from the Json.

**Module**: Interface-implementing class that takes values from the Module Data to use them in logic executed on the
particle (`render`,`init`,`update`).

**Particle Module Data**: Defines the modules to attach to the particle.

```mermaid

moduledata-->modules
emitter--uses-->data--to apply-->modules--to -->particle
particle-->pmodules-->particle
```

`ParticleModuleData.addModules` is called on the Data of every Module applied to the Particle when the particle is
spawned and can be used to add different modules based on the module data. For example there’s only a `LightModuleData`
which, depending if a color or alpha gradient is defined, either adds a `StaticLightModule` or a `DynamicLightModule` to
the particle to save calculations.

The Module itself consists of a Class that implements a `ParticleModule` Interface for the Particle‘s lifecycle:
`Render`, `Update`, `Init`, `Force` and `Collision` and gets passed the values that were defined in its Module Data
file.

Each Module Type has to be registered in the [
`ParticleModuleTypeRegistry`](https://github.com/FoundryMC/Veil/blob/1.20/common/src/main/java/foundry/veil/api/quasar/data/ParticleModuleTypeRegistry.java)
so that Veil knows how to read it from the Module Data files.
